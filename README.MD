Sure! Here's a README.md template tailored for a final-year project. I’ve created a professional structure with placeholders where you can fill in your specific details. Since I see you're working on an IoT-based Smart Sewage Monitoring System (from context), I've tailored it accordingly.

Feel free to copy, modify, and expand:

# IoT-Based Smart Sewage Monitoring System

An intelligent IoT solution for real-time monitoring, alerting, and management of urban sewage systems. This project integrates hardware sensors, cloud services, and a web/mobile dashboard to help municipal authorities prevent overflow and toxic gas build-up in drainage systems.

## 📖 About the Project

Sewage overflow and toxic gas leaks pose major health and environmental threats in urban areas. Our project aims to build a smart, automated monitoring system using IoT sensors and a centralized dashboard. The system collects real-time data from manholes and drainage sites, identifies risks, and provides actionable insights for sanitation workers and city planners.

## ✅ Features

* Real-time level and gas monitoring using ultrasonic and gas sensors.
* ESP8266-based wireless data transmission to a cloud database.
* Web dashboard with map-based visualization and shortest route suggestions.
* Feedback portal accessible via QR code on manholes.
* AI-powered anomaly detection and spam feedback filtering (optional).
* Admin panel to assign tasks and analyze trends.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

Frontend:

* React.js (Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit)
* MapLibre gl js 

Backend:

* Node.js / Express.js
* MongoDB Atlas (Cloud DB)

Hardware:

* ESP32 Wi-Fi Module
* MQ-135 Gas Sensor
* Ultrasonic Level Sensor



Other Tools:

* Git & GitHub
* Figma (UI Design)
* Postman (API testing)

## 🧱 System Architecture

1. Sensor Node collects data from manholes.
2. ESP32 transmits data to the backend API.
3. Backend stores sensor readings in MongoDB.
4. Frontend dashboard fetches data via REST API.
5. Admin users view alerts, assign workers, and monitor conditions.
6. Optional ML module predicts critical events.

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sewage-monitoring-system.git
cd sewage-monitoring-system
```

Install dependencies:

Frontend:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Backend:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Ensure MongoDB Atlas URI is set in a .env file.

## 🚀 Usage

* Connect ESP8266 to sensors and Wi-Fi.
* Power the device and monitor console logs.
* Open the frontend at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
* Login as admin or worker to view and manage the system.
